# English Dictionary 
A Python and JSON as a data file based English to English Dictionary that lets you find the meaning of word you enter.
Creating a Simple Python Script which when given the word will return the meaning,thus acting as a small CLI(Command Line Interface) based Dictionary
If the Word doesn't exist in the database it will return something like not available etc or a user oriented message.

''' Here the data format or the data file is a JSON file i.e. JavaScript Object Notation it is like a language (not a language though) It's a set of rule about how to format a data?
Thus JSON follows the format as you can see when opened in text editor: It starts with curly brackets, and we've few pairs of keys and values and thus forming an extensive ordered database
and Similar like a python dictionary and the keys are separated by the values using a colon ':'
*** The values are in square brackets which means at certain cases you may have multiple values of the item enclosed in "__" and the multiple entities of the values are separated by ','.
*** This is because : Some words may have more than one meaning.
*** Hence it is similar to python dictionary.
*** To access the data you first need to load it into python as a specific python datatype, later you access the data from the datatype.

Rest the program working, application is explained within the dictScript.py file where a novice or a begineer can understand it easily.
